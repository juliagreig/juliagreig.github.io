      <description>So you might know I&amp;rsquo;m making a video game! How cool! I’ve been working on my game for about 6 months now and thought I’d write a bit of an update on what I’m doing, what I’m not doing, and what I’ve learned so far.
Avoiding self rebellion I’ve realized in this process that I really work best with no plan at all. I started this game not knowing what I was going to make, and I feel like now I still barely have an idea of what my game is going to turn into.</description>

      <description>I was born and raised in Canada but currently live in India with my sweetheart.
I have a degree in computer engineering that I am very proud of, and I use nothing that I learned from school in real life.
I work remotely for a lovely start up company back home doing web development, graphic design, marketing, growth engineering, product management, among other things. Startup life = many hats, and I’m the tech guy.</description>
